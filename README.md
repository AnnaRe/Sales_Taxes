===========

IDE: DEV-C++ Version 4.9.9.2  (http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html)

Programming language : C++

Assumption :

1) Display only output as given in problem

2) Tested only with hard coded data

3) Display logic could change

4) Tax could be added / removed

5) Goods can be only local or imported

6) Goods types are : BOOK, FOOD, MEDICALPROD or OTHERS

7) Calculation logic could change


Calculation logic:

- sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products

- import duty rate of 5% on imported items

- a receipt lists the name of all the items in a basket, the number of items and their price (including tax), 
  finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid.

- The rounding rules is: np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05
